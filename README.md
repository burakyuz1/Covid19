# CoronaApi
[M-Media-Group](https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API) is used as API resource in my project.

I request to the API using the .Net 5 asynchronous programming. I also used AJAX to render the page asynchronously.

Since the API is updated daily by [M-Media-Group](https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API), your request will be cached for 24 hours.
